16 * 2 LCD
MAX30100 Pulse Oximeter
Jumpers
Breadboard
3 Resistors 4.7k
Buzzer
##  project objectives and its effect on medical field :-
This project aims to help combat the emerging corona virus epidemic by means of discovering the symptoms of this disease, and the most important of these symptoms are low oxygen level in the blood, and palpitations in the patient's heartbeat.
The patient can measure these things by simply touching the sensor with his finger, and the LCD screen will display the values of oxygen level in the blood, and heart rates.
in condition of the oxygen saturation in the blood less than 95% which is the normal range , and the heart rates is more than the normal range which is 60-99 BPM , we suppose that person is coronavirus suspected.
And by that, we reduce the burden on the medical staff to check these vital functions for every person suspected of having Corona , in addition it is low cost for any person.
